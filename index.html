  <h1>Katelynn Brown</h1>
    <p class="bio"> I am currently a junior at Virginia Tech, majoring in public relations and minoring in digital marketing. During my sophomore year of college, I started my job as a production assistant, working for the ACC Network. This job has pointed me in the direction of where I want to go, and what I want to do after I graduate here. I am incredibly greatful for the opportunities I have had, which led me to where I am today.

          <h2>Passion for Photography</h2>
          <p class="description">I first got into photography when I was young. I was at my sister's soccer game when my grandfather handed me his camera. From that game on, I looked forward to going to her games, soley so I could take pictures. As I got older, my passion for photography contiuned to grow, and it brought me to where I am today. <a href="https://katelynnbrown.myportfolio.com">In my college life</a> I have taken numerous graduation  photos, and even some action shots for Virginia Tech athletics. If college has taught me anything, it has taught me that I should follow my passion. I chose to major in public relations because I fell in love with the person with the camera. I found happiness looking back at the photos and seeign what I captured. Whether it is a home run celebration shot, or a senior popping champagne, there is something about that feeling you get when you see what you captured. I hope I never lose that feeling.</p>
